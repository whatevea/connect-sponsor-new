# Monorepo Project with Next.js, React, and Material UI

## Overview

This project follows a **monorepo** structure, which is a single repository containing multiple related projects or packages. This setup allows us to easily share code between different parts of the project while keeping everything organized in one place.

We use **Turborepo** to manage our monorepo efficiently, and **pnpm** for dependency management across packages. **Material UI** is used as the main UI framework.

3. **packages/ui/**  
   The **UI** package contains shared Material UI components, themes, and design constants. It ensures UI consistency across both the **admin dashboard** and **Next.js website**.

4. **packages/eslint-config/**  
   A shared ESLint configuration package to maintain consistent coding standards across all apps and packages.

5. **packages/typescript-config/**
